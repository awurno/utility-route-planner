# utility-route-planner
The utility network needs to be expanded due to the energy transition. Finding a location for new infrastructure is no
easy feat considering the amount of involved design criteria. This research includes the creation of a software package
for automatic placement of utility network using a combination of geo-information and graph theory.

# Installation
To install the utility-route-designer package, run:
```bash
poetry install
```

# Usage
Running the main file will create utility routes for the five included cases in the `data/examples` folder. Optionally edit the configuration file `mcda_presets.py` to change the weights of the environmental criteria. 
```bash
python main.py
```
The resulting geopackages and tifs are placed in the `data/processed` folder. View them in QGIS or similar GIS GUI.

Run tests using pytest:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
